# Looqbox FrontEnd Challenge
![Looqbox](https://github.com/looqbox/looqbox-frontend-challenge/blob/master/logo.png)

## Challenge
In this challenge you will need to build a **S**ingle **P**age **A**pplication using ReactJS and a provided api

We will not use anything from your project and you are free to use it in your portfolio

## Stack
We use:
- ReactJS for the front end framework
- Webpack and Yarn for dependency management and local deployment

But you can use Node and Npm if you prefer :)

## Submitting
- Make a fork of this repository
- When you're done send us a pull request

# Guidelines
You need to make a SPA that shows a list of pokemons, and search them, using the [Pokeapi](https://pokeapi.co/), your app needs to be dynamic, that means you **do not** reload the page to show anything new.

The pokeapi was chosen because of its simplicity to make the requests, as it is a open api, please mind how many times you request data

In the main page you need a search bar and a loaded list of pokemons (random or just hardcoded)

Searching and pressing enter on the search bar will show the result instead of the list

You can use any dependency you want, (axios, bootstrap, material ui...)

## Bonus points!
- A view with more details about the pokemon selected in the list
- Graphs!
- Unit Testing
- Linting
- Nice UI
- Explain Code architecture
- Documentation
