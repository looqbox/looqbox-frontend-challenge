![Looqbox](https://github.com/looqbox/looqbox-frontend-challenge/blob/master/logo.png)

## Challenge
In this challenge you will need to build a **S**ingle **P**age **A**pplication using ReactJS and a provided api

We will not use anything from your project other than evaluate your skills and you are free to use it in your portfolio

## Stack
We use:
- ReactJS
- Redux
- TypeScript
- AntDesign

## Submitting
- Make a fork of this repository
- Create your branch
- ⚠️ Do a initial Commit when you start
- ⚠️ Do a final commit when you finish
- When you're done send us a pull request

You have **one week** to finish your test, we'll check the time with your "Initial" and "Final" Commits.

# Guidelines
You need to make a SPA that shows a list of pokemons, and search them, using the [Pokeapi](https://pokeapi.co/), your app needs to be dynamic, that means you **do not** reload the page to show anything new.

The pokeapi was chosen because of its simplicity to make the requests, as it is a open api, please **mind how many times you request data**

- In the main page you need a search bar and a loaded list of pokemons (random or just hardcoded)
- Clicking on any pokemon shows a card/modal/page with that pokemon's info
- Searching and pressing enter on the search bar will show the result instead of the list
- Your app needs at least two different routes (/home /more for example -> be creative!)

You can use any dependency you want, (axios, bootstrap, material ui...)
