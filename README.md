# Guidelines

You need to create a Single Page Application (SPA) that displays a list of Pokémon and allows users to search for them, using the [Pokeapi](https://pokeapi.co/docs/v2). Your app must be dynamic, meaning you **must not** reload the page to show new content.

The PokeAPI was chosen for its simplicity in making requests. Since it is an open API, please **be mindful of how many requests** you make.

## Requirements:

- On the main page, include a search bar and a preloaded list of Pokémon.
- Clicking on any Pokémon should display a card, modal, or page with that Pokémon’s information.
- Typing in the search bar and pressing Enter should display the search result instead of the list.
- Your app must include at least two different routes (e.g., /home, /details — be creative!).
- Add a README file to document your project.

You may use any libraries or dependencies you like (e.g., Axios, Bootstrap, Material UI...).
